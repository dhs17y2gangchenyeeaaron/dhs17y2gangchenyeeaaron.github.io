    <h2><font color="green">Interests</font></h2>
  <p>I have two hobbies that I enjoy doing during my free time. Baking and playing the piano.I enjoy baking because it is the only chance 
  that i can use my creative juices to try out new recipies and decorate them with anything i like. I treat everything i bake as a form
  of art, the one and only in the world. I enjoy playing the piano as it allows me to express my emotions through music and at the same time,
  when i play infront of my parents or friends, it builds up my confidence too.</p>
